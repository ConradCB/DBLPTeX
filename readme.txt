This is a small tool written simplify my references for my thesis.  Released into the public domain in case anyone else can use it!

The idea is to take a small, annotated file of links to DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/) reference pages, and automatically produce a BibTeX file to use.
To understand the aim of the script, see the example.

As I've just written it for myself, it's configured to my BibTeX preferences (no cross-refs, using "refs.bib").
Also it will probably break as soon as DBLP changes anything.

Written using python 3.4.3
