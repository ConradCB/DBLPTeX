# This is a source file for a custom python script, to extract the BibTeX references from DBLP and compile them into a new file.
# Lines beginning with a #-sign are ignored by the script.  This allows easy commenting of the references.
# Other lines follow the syntax of <desired citation key>,<URL of DBLP bibtex reference>
# Note the use of /bibtex1/ in the url, this means DBLP doesn't use crossrefs.  Currently the script is not configured to work with anything else!
# If necessary, we may write the script to handle custom references in this file, syntax TBD.

# To use the script, simply run the bib_generator.py script in the same directory as this example file.  It will output a refs.bib file.
